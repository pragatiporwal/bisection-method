Numerical analysis provide approximate solutions.it does not strive for exactness. 
Transcendental equation are non algebraic equations involving transcendental function such as exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, or hyperbolic function.

An algebraic equation of degree n is P(x)=a0 xn + a1 xn-1  + …..+an = 0
Where a0,a1,….an are real numbers and a0 !=0 and n>=1.

In General form f(x) = 0
Where the function must be continuous on the interval a< x <b.
